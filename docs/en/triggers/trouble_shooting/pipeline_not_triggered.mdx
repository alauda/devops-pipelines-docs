# The Pipeline is not automatically triggered

## Problem Description

After creating the `Pipeline` and `Trigger` using `Pipelines` functionality through the UI console, the `Pipeline` is not automatically triggered even though the event is sent (i.e the code is pushed).

## Root Cause Analysis

There are several possible causes for this issue:

1. The webhook configuration was not set up correctly.
2. The `EventListener` was not deployed, or is not listening `Triggers` in the target namespace, or may be filtering out the event.
3. The `ServiceAccount` used by the `EventListener` deployment does not have enough permissions.
4. The `Trigger` is not configured correctly.

## Problem Investigation

Given the possible issues mentioned above, follow the steps to find the root cause of the problem:

### Webhook configuration was not setup correctly

  1. Access your repository/settings using an account with appropriate permissions.
  2. Check all webhook settings and confirm with the platform administrator details regarding the target address of the webhook.
  3. Make sure the required events are enabled by the webhook. For Gitlab events, please refer to [GitLab Event Triggers](../how_to/gitlab_events.mdx)


### EventListener not deployed or setup incorrectly

  1. Verify with the Platform Administrator that the `EventListener` was deployed and can be reached from the event source (i.e Gitlab instance).
  2. Access the `EventListener` resource and check if it is listening `Triggers` in the target namespace checking the `EventListener` resource `spec`, it should have the `namespaceSelector` field set to `*` or listing the target namespace.
  3. Make sure that `interceptors` inside `EventListener` resource are not filtering out the event.
  4. Check the `EventListener` logs for any errors or warnings. This is possible through the `kubectl` command: `kubectl logs <eventlistener-pod-name> -n <namespace>`
  5. Make sure the `ServiceAccount` used by the `EventListener` has appropriate permissions, including `create` permissions for the `PipelineRun` resource.

For a detailed documentation on EventListener configuration please see [EventListener](../how_to/eventlistener.mdx)


### Trigger not configured correctly

  1. Verify that the `Trigger` was configured correctly, making sure the parameters from `TriggerBinding` or `ClusterTriggerBinding` match those used in the `TriggerTemplate`.

For a detailed documentation on how to setup `Trigger` using Gitlab events as example, please see [Gitlab Events](../how_to/gitlab_events.mdx)
