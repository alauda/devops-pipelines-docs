# Interceptor

An Interceptor is a powerful component in Tekton Triggers that processes and filters event data before it reaches TriggerBindings and TriggerTemplates. It acts as a gatekeeper and transformer for incoming webhook events, allowing you to validate, filter, and modify event data to ensure only relevant events trigger your pipelines.

## Terminology Explanation

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Interceptor | A component that processes webhook events before they reach TriggerBindings and TriggerTemplates. |
| ClusterInterceptor | A cluster-scoped Interceptor that can be used across all namespaces. |
| CEL | Common Expression Language, used for filtering and transforming event data. |
| Extensions | Additional data fields added by Interceptors that can be accessed by TriggerBindings. |
| Webhook | An HTTP callback that delivers event data when specific events occur in external systems. |

## Why We Need Interceptors

### The Challenge of Event Processing

In CI/CD systems that respond to external events, several challenges arise:

1. **Event Validation**: External webhooks need verification to ensure they come from trusted sources.
2. **Event Filtering**: Not all events should trigger pipelines; you need to filter based on event types or content.
3. **Data Transformation**: Raw webhook payloads often contain more data than needed or require restructuring.
4. **Security Concerns**: Without proper validation, webhook endpoints could be vulnerable to abuse.

Without Interceptors, addressing these challenges would require:
- Custom validation code for each webhook source
- Complex logic embedded in pipeline definitions
- Manual filtering and transformation in scripts
- Separate security mechanisms for each integration

### How Interceptors Address These Problems

Interceptors provide a standardized, declarative way to:

1. **Validate Events**: Verify webhook signatures and tokens to ensure authenticity.
2. **Filter Events**: Process only relevant events based on type, content, or other criteria.
3. **Transform Data**: Extract, modify, or add data to make it more suitable for pipeline consumption.
4. **Enhance Security**: Implement consistent security practices across all webhook integrations.
5. **Modularize Logic**: Separate event processing concerns from pipeline execution.

This approach creates a clean separation between event reception, processing, and pipeline execution, making your CI/CD system more maintainable and secure.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security**: Validate webhook authenticity before processing
- **Reduced Pipeline Complexity**: Move filtering and transformation logic out of pipelines
- **Standardized Processing**: Consistent handling of events across different sources
- **Flexibility**: Chain multiple interceptors for complex processing requirements
- **Extensibility**: Create custom interceptors for specialized processing needs
- **Reusability**: Define interceptors once and reuse them across multiple triggers
- **Declarative Configuration**: Configure event processing using Kubernetes resources

## Applicable Scenarios

Interceptors are essential in the following scenarios:

1. **Secure Webhook Processing**: When you need to validate that webhook events come from trusted sources.

2. **Conditional Pipeline Execution**: When you want to trigger pipelines only for specific event types or content (e.g., only on push events to the main branch).

3. **Data Enrichment**: When you need to add computed values or extract specific data from complex event payloads.

4. **Multi-source Integration**: When integrating with multiple webhook providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) with consistent processing.

5. **Custom Event Processing**: When implementing specialized logic for event handling beyond what's available in standard interceptors.

## Constraints and Limitations

- Interceptors add processing overhead to event handling
- Complex CEL expressions can be difficult to debug
- Custom interceptors require additional deployment and management
- HTTPS is recommended for security, and HTTP support will be removed in future versions
- Interceptors must be properly secured to prevent unauthorized access

## Principles

### Interceptor Architecture

Interceptors sit between the EventListener and the Trigger processing pipeline:

1. **EventListener** receives the webhook event
2. **Interceptors** process and filter the event
3. **TriggerBindings** extract data from the processed event
4. **TriggerTemplates** create resources using the extracted data

Interceptors can be chained together, with each interceptor receiving the output from the previous one. This allows for complex processing pipelines where each interceptor performs a specific function.

### Types of Interceptors

Tekton Triggers supports two implementations of interceptors:

1. **Standalone Interceptors**: Implemented as separate Kubernetes services
   - **Interceptor**: Namespace-scoped custom resource
   - **ClusterInterceptor**: Cluster-scoped custom resource
   - More flexible and easier to extend
   - Can be implemented in any language that can serve HTTP requests

2. **Built-in Interceptors**: Included in the EventListener pod
   - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, CEL, etc.
   - Retained for backward compatibility
   - Simpler to use but less extensible

### Interceptor Structure

A basic Interceptor resource has the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Interceptor
metadata:
  name: my-interceptor
spec:
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: my-interceptor-svc
      namespace: default
      path: "/optional-path"  # Optional
      port: 8081  # Defaults to 80
```

When referenced in a Trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: trigger-with-interceptor
    interceptors:
      - ref:
          name: "my-interceptor"
          kind: Interceptor  # Or ClusterInterceptor
          namespace: default  # Required only for Interceptor
        params:  # Optional parameters
          - name: "param1"
            value: "value1"
```

## Configuration Examples

### GitHub Interceptor Example

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: github-push-trigger
    interceptors:
      - ref:
          name: "github"
        params:
          - name: "secretRef"
            value:
              secretName: github-secret
              secretKey: secretToken
          - name: "eventTypes"
            value: ["push"]
          - name: "branches"
            value: ["main", "release/*"]
```

### GitLab Interceptor with CEL Example

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: gitlab-merge-request-trigger
    interceptors:
      - ref:
          name: "gitlab"
        params:
          - name: "secretRef"
            value:
              secretName: gitlab-secret
              secretKey: secretToken
          - name: "eventTypes"
            value: ["Merge Request Hook"]
      - ref:
          name: "cel"
        params:
          - name: "filter"
            value: "body.object_attributes.state == 'opened' || body.object_attributes.state == 'reopened'"
          - name: "overlays"
            value:
              - key: truncated_sha
                expression: "body.object_attributes.last_commit.id.truncate(7)"
```

### Custom Interceptor Example

1. Create a Deployment for your custom interceptor:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: custom-interceptor
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: custom-interceptor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: custom-interceptor
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: custom-interceptor
          image: custom-interceptor:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

2. Create a Service for your custom interceptor:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: custom-interceptor-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: custom-interceptor
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

3. Register your custom interceptor:

```yaml
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterInterceptor
metadata:
  name: custom-interceptor
spec:
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: custom-interceptor-svc
      namespace: default
      port: 80
```

## Important Parameter Explanations Related to Interceptors

### CEL Expressions

CEL (Common Expression Language) is a powerful tool used in the CEL interceptor for filtering and transforming event data.

#### Applicable Scenarios

- Filtering events based on complex conditions
- Extracting specific data from event payloads
- Creating new fields based on existing data
- Implementing conditional logic

#### Constraints and Limitations

- Complex expressions can be difficult to debug
- Limited to the functionality provided by CEL
- Performance impact with very complex expressions

#### Principles/Parameter Explanation

Common CEL patterns:

- Accessing body fields: `body.repository.full_name`
- Accessing header fields: `header.X-GitHub-Event`
- String operations: `body.ref.split('/')[2]`
- Conditionals: `body.action in ['opened', 'reopened', 'synchronize']`
- Boolean logic: `body.pull_request.base.ref == 'main' && body.action == 'opened'`

#### Configuration Examples

```yaml
- ref:
    name: "cel"
  params:
    - name: "filter"
      value: "header.match('X-GitHub-Event', 'pull_request') && body.action in ['opened', 'reopened', 'synchronize']"
    - name: "overlays"
      value:
        - key: branch_name
          expression: "body.pull_request.head.ref"
        - key: is_main_target
          expression: "body.pull_request.base.ref == 'main'"
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Running interceptors over HTTPS is recommended for security and will be required in future versions.

#### Applicable Scenarios

- Production environments
- Handling sensitive data
- Compliance with security requirements

#### Constraints and Limitations

- Requires proper certificate management
- Additional configuration compared to HTTP

#### Principles/Parameter Explanation

To configure an interceptor for HTTPS:

1. Add the `server/type: https` label to your interceptor
2. Provide a CA bundle for certificate validation
3. Ensure your interceptor service is configured to serve HTTPS

#### Configuration Examples

```yaml
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Interceptor
metadata:
  name: secure-interceptor
  labels:
    server/type: https
spec:
  clientConfig:
    caBundle: "BASE64_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE"
    service:
      name: secure-interceptor-svc
      namespace: default
      port: 8443
```
