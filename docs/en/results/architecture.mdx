# Architecture

<img src="/results/architecture.svg" width="300" />

## Introduction

This architecture diagram illustrates the overall structure of Tekton Results. The main components include:

1. **User**: Creates TaskRuns or PipelineRuns through the Kubernetes API.
2. **Pipeline Controller**: Responsible for managing and executing TaskRuns and PipelineRuns.
3. **Results Watcher**: Monitors changes to all TaskRuns/PipelineRuns and sends updates to the Results API.
4. **Results API Server**: A queryable gRPC API server that is responsible for storing and managing all results data.
5. **Persistent Storage**: Used to store all results data, ensuring data persistence and reliability.

Through this architectural design, Tekton Results effectively separates the historical record storage of CI/CD workloads and provides flexible result querying and management capabilities.
