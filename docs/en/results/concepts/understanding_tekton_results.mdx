# Tekton Results

Tekton Results is a sophisticated system that extends Tekton's capabilities by providing persistent storage, querying, and management of CI/CD execution data. This document provides a deeper exploration of how Tekton Results works, its architecture, and how to leverage its features effectively.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Result | A top-level resource that groups related Records together, representing a logical unit of work |
| Record | An individual instance of data (TaskRun, PipelineRun, Log) that belongs to a Result |
| Watcher | A Kubernetes controller that monitors TaskRuns and PipelineRuns and stores them in the Results database |
| API Server | A gRPC/REST server that provides access to stored Results and Records |
| Retention Policy | Rules that determine how long data is kept in the Results database |

## Why We Need Tekton Results

### The Challenge of CI/CD Data Management

In traditional Kubernetes-based CI/CD systems like Tekton Pipelines, all execution data is stored in the Kubernetes API server's etcd database. This approach has several limitations:

- **Limited Storage Capacity**: etcd is designed for storing small amounts of configuration data, not large volumes of execution history and logs
- **Resource Constraints**: As CI/CD workloads accumulate, they can consume significant etcd resources, potentially affecting cluster performance
- **Data Fragmentation**: Related CI/CD activities (TaskRuns, PipelineRuns) are stored as separate resources without explicit relationships
- **Log Management**: Logs are typically stored in the container runtime or external logging systems, making it difficult to associate them with specific pipeline executions
- **Data Lifecycle**: There's no built-in mechanism for managing the lifecycle of completed CI/CD data

These limitations become increasingly problematic as CI/CD usage scales, leading to potential performance issues and administrative overhead.

### How Tekton Results Addresses These Challenges

Tekton Results provides a comprehensive solution by:

1. **Offloading Data Storage**: Moving completed CI/CD execution data from etcd to a dedicated database optimized for this purpose
2. **Establishing Relationships**: Creating explicit relationships between related CI/CD activities through the Result/Record data model
3. **Centralizing Log Storage**: Storing logs alongside their associated TaskRuns/PipelineRuns
4. **Providing Data Lifecycle Management**: Implementing retention policies to automatically manage data over time
5. **Enabling Advanced Querying**: Offering powerful filtering and querying capabilities beyond what's possible with the Kubernetes API

## Advantages

- **Improved Cluster Performance**: Reduces load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd by offloading completed CI/CD data
- **Enhanced Data Organization**: Groups related CI/CD activities together for better visibility and management
- **Longer Data Retention**: Enables long-term storage of execution history without impacting cluster resources
- **Powerful Querying**: Provides advanced filtering and search capabilities for CI/CD data
- **Integrated Log Management**: Stores logs alongside execution data for comprehensive pipeline history
- **Automated Cleanup**: Manages data lifecycle through configurable retention policies

## Applicable Scenarios

Tekton Results is particularly valuable in the following scenarios:

1. **High-Volume CI/CD Environments**: Organizations running numerous pipelines that generate substantial execution data
2. **Compliance Requirements**: Environments that need to maintain execution history for audit or compliance purposes
3. **Resource-Constrained Clusters**: Clusters where etcd resources are limited and need to be optimized
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Teams that want to perform analysis and reporting on CI/CD execution patterns
5. **Multi-Team Environments**: Organizations where multiple teams share Tekton infrastructure and need isolated views of their CI/CD data

## Architecture and Principles

Tekton Results follows a microservices architecture with three main components that work together to provide a complete solution:

### API Server Architecture

The API Server is the central component that:

1. **Provides Data Access**: Exposes gRPC and REST endpoints for storing and retrieving Results and Records
2. **Manages Authentication**: Uses Kubernetes-style authentication (service accounts, tokens)
3. **Enforces Authorization**: Implements RBAC-based access control for Results resources
4. **Handles Data Persistence**: Interfaces with the underlying database (PostgreSQL)
5. **Supports Filtering**: Implements CEL (Common Expression Language) for powerful query filtering

The API Server uses a parent-child hierarchy where:
- Namespaces/workspaces are parents of Results
- Results are parents of Records
- Records contain the actual execution data

### Watcher Architecture

The Watcher operates as a Kubernetes controller that:

1. **Monitors Resources**: Listens for TaskRun and PipelineRun events in the cluster
2. **Determines Grouping**: Uses annotations, labels, and owner references to group related resources
3. **Creates/Updates Records**: Stores execution data in the Results database via the API Server
4. **Annotates Resources**: Adds Result identifiers to the original Kubernetes resources
5. **Manages Deletion**: Optionally deletes completed resources after they're stored in the database

The Watcher uses several strategies to group related resources:
- `results.tekton.dev/result` annotation
- `triggers.tekton.dev/triggers-eventid` label
- Owner references to PipelineRuns
- Automatic generation of new Result names when no grouping information is found

### Retention Policy Agent Architecture

The Retention Policy Agent is responsible for:

1. **Scheduling Cleanup**: Running pruning jobs according to a configured schedule
2. **Enforcing Retention**: Removing data that exceeds the configured retention period
3. **Managing Database Size**: Preventing unbounded growth of the Results database

## Data Model In-Depth

### Result Structure

A Result contains:

```
Result
├── metadata
│   ├── name
│   ├── uid
│   ├── createTime
│   ├── updateTime
│   └── annotations (key-value pairs)
└── summary
    ├── type (e.g., PIPELINE_RUN, TASK_RUN)
    ├── status (SUCCESS, FAILURE, TIMEOUT, CANCELLED, UNKNOWN)
    ├── startTime
    ├── endTime
    └── annotations (key-value pairs)
```

### Record Structure

A Record contains:

```
Record
├── name
├── data
│   ├── type (e.g., tekton.dev/v1.TaskRun, tekton.dev/v1.PipelineRun, results.tekton.dev/v1alpha3.Log)
│   └── value (serialized data)
└── createTime
```

## Authentication and Authorization

Tekton Results uses Kubernetes-style authentication and RBAC for access control:

1. **Authentication**: Uses service account tokens, user impersonation, and other Kubernetes authentication methods
2. **Authorization**: Implements RBAC with resources (`results`, `records`) and verbs (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`)
3. **Namespace Isolation**: Scopes permissions per namespace for multi-tenant environments

Example RBAC roles:
- `tekton-results-readonly`: Read-only access to Results and Records
- `tekton-results-readwrite`: Read and write access to Results and Records
- `tekton-results-admin`: Full access including deletion of Results and Records

## Advanced Filtering

Tekton Results uses CEL (Common Expression Language) for powerful filtering capabilities:

```
# Filter by Result status
results.tekton.dev/v1alpha2/parents/default/results?filter=summary.status==SUCCESS

# Filter by creation time
results.tekton.dev/v1alpha2/parents/default/results?filter=create_time>timestamp('2023-01-01T00:00:00Z')

# Filter Records by data type
results.tekton.dev/v1alpha2/parents/default/results/123/records?filter=data_type=='tekton.dev/v1.TaskRun'

# Complex filtering with logical operators
results.tekton.dev/v1alpha2/parents/default/results?filter=summary.status==SUCCESS&&create_time>timestamp('2023-01-01T00:00:00Z')
```
