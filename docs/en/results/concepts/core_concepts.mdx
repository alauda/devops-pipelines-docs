# Core Concepts

This document introduces the fundamental concepts of Tekton Results, helping you understand its purpose, components, and data model.

## What is Tekton Results?

Tekton Results is a component of the Tekton CI/CD ecosystem that provides long-term storage and querying capabilities for Tekton execution data. It helps users logically group CI/CD workload history and separate long-term result storage away from the Pipeline controller.

The primary benefits of Tekton Results include:

- **Persistent Storage**: Store execution history (TaskRuns, PipelineRuns, logs) in a dedicated database instead of Kubernetes etcd
- **Result Grouping**: Group related workloads together (e.g., bundle related TaskRuns and PipelineRuns into a single unit)
- **Resource Optimization**: Free up etcd resources by moving completed runs to external storage
- **Log Retention**: Store logs produced by TaskRuns/PipelineRuns so that completed runs can be cleaned to save cluster resources

## Key Components

Tekton Results consists of three main components:

### 1. API Server

The API server provides a queryable gRPC and REST interface backed by persistent storage. It allows users to:

- Store and retrieve execution data (TaskRuns, PipelineRuns, logs)
- Query and filter results based on various criteria
- Group related executions together

The API server uses Kubernetes-style authentication and authorization, making it familiar to users of the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### 2. Watcher

The Watcher is a Kubernetes controller that:

- Watches for TaskRun and PipelineRun changes in the cluster
- Automatically creates or updates corresponding Records in the Results database
- Annotates the original TaskRun/PipelineRun objects with Result identifiers
- Optionally deletes completed runs after they've been stored in the database

The Watcher ensures that execution data is automatically captured without requiring changes to your existing Tekton workflows.

### 3. Retention Policy Agent

The Retention Policy Agent manages the lifecycle of stored data by:

- Removing older Results and their associated Records from the database based on configurable policies
- Running pruning jobs according to a schedule
- Enforcing maximum retention periods for execution data

## Data Model

Tekton Results uses a hierarchical data model consisting of two primary entities:

### Results

Results are top-level aggregators that group related Records together. They represent a logical unit of work, such as a CI/CD pipeline execution triggered by a specific event. Results contain:

- A unique identifier
- Metadata (creation time, update time)
- Annotations (key-value pairs for custom metadata)
- Summary information (status, type, etc.)

### Records

Records are individual instances of data that belong to a Result. They represent specific artifacts or events within a CI/CD workflow, such as:

- TaskRun executions
- PipelineRun executions
- Log data
- Event data

Records contain:

- A unique name
- A reference to their parent Result
- A data type identifier (e.g., `tekton.dev/v1.TaskRun`, `tekton.dev/v1.PipelineRun`)
- The actual data content (stored as a serialized object)

This data model allows for flexible organization of CI/CD execution data, making it easier to track and query related activities.

## Life of a Result

The typical flow of data through Tekton Results is as follows:

1. A user creates a TaskRun or PipelineRun via the Kubernetes API
2. The Result Watcher detects the new resource and monitors its changes
3. When the TaskRun/PipelineRun is updated, the Watcher creates or updates corresponding Records in the Results database
4. The Watcher annotates the original TaskRun/PipelineRun with Result identifiers
5. Users can query the Results API to retrieve execution data
6. Once the data is safely stored in the Results database, the original Kubernetes resources can be safely removed from the cluster

This flow ensures that execution data is preserved even after the original Kubernetes resources are deleted, providing a complete history of CI/CD activities.
