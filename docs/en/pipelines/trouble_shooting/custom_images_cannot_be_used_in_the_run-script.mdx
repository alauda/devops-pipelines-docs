# Permission Issues When Using Custom Images in run-script Task

## Problem Description

When using custom images in the Tekton run-script Task, you may encounter issues with insufficient file permissions. This situation usually occurs when the Task is configured to run with a non-root user, while the applications in the custom image require root permissions to function properly, or when there is no non-root user with UID 65532 in the image.

### Error Manifestation

TaskRun execution fails, and the Pod logs display insufficient permissions:

```text
** Permission denied
```

## Root Cause Analysis

This issue is typically caused by the following reasons:

1. The `run-script` Task is configured with `runAsUser: 65532`, forcing the Pod to run as a non-root user.
2. The applications in the custom image require root permissions to execute certain operations, or there is no non-root user with UID 65532 in the image.
3. The application attempts to access or modify directories or files without permission.

Example Task Configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: run-script
spec:
  steps:
    - name: run-script
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 65532
```

## Problem Troubleshooting

If this issue occurs only when using the custom image, it is recommended to troubleshoot as follows:

1. Verify whether there are insufficient permissions with the image when run as the root user:
   ```bash
   $ docker run -it --rm --user root ${registry} ${cmd}
   ```

2. Check if the application allows user 65532 to access specific directories or files:
   ```bash
   $ docker run -it --rm --user 65532:65532 ${registry} ${cmd} ls -la /path/to/directory
   ```

3. Check the securityContext configuration of the Task:
   ```bash
   $ kubectl get task run-script -o yaml | grep -E 'runAsUser|runAsNonRoot'
   ```

## Solution

### Option 1: Adjust the Custom Image Build Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- Access and permissions to rebuild the image.

#### Steps

1. Refer to the document on [Adjusting Dockerfile for Task-Compatible Custom Images](../how_to/adjust_dockerfile_for_task_compatible_image.mdx) to modify the Dockerfile configuration.
2. Ensure that the applications in the image can run normally as user 65532.
3. Set appropriate permissions for directories and files.

### Option 2: Adjust the Application Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- The application supports configuration adjustments via environment variables or parameters.

#### Steps

1. Set the `HOME` environment variable to point to a directory where permissions are adequate:
   ```bash
   # Set HOME environment variable to a temporary directory
   $ export HOME=$(mktemp -d)
   # Set git's safe.directory configuration
   $ git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace/source
   ```

2. Use application parameters to specify the location of the configuration file:
   ```bash
   # Use skopeo's --authfile parameter to specify the location of the authentication file
   $ skopeo --authfile /workspace/auth.json copy docker://${registry}/${image}:${tag} docker://${registry}/${image}:${tag}
   ```

### Option 3: Modify the Task Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- Permissions to modify the Task.
- Evaluate security risks.

#### Steps

1. Remove the runAsNonRoot and runAsUser configurations:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
   kind: Task
   metadata:
     name: run-script
   spec:
     steps:
       - name: run-script
         securityContext:
           # runAsNonRoot: true
           # runAsUser: 65532
   ```

2. Alternatively, modify runAsUser to a user with sufficient permissions:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
   kind: Task
   metadata:
     name: run-script
   spec:
     steps:
       - name: run-script
         securityContext:
           # runAsNonRoot: true
           runAsUser: 0
   ```

## Preventive Measures

1. Image Build
   - Prefer building images with non-root users.
   - Use UID 65532 consistently as a non-root user.
   - Ensure that applications can run normally as non-root users.
   - Set appropriate permissions for directories and files.

2. Permission Management
   - Follow the principle of least privilege.
   - Plan directory permissions in advance.
   - Regularly review permission configurations.
   - Avoid running containers as root users.

3. Application Configuration
   - Use environment variables or parameters to adjust configurations.
   - Avoid hard-coding file paths.
   - Support customization of configuration file locations.
