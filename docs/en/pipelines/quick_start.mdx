# Quick Start

This document helps new users quickly understand and use Tekton Pipelines to create a simple CI/CD workflow.

## Introduction

Tekton is an open-source cloud native CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) solution. It provides Kubernetes-native building blocks for creating containerized, standardized, and portable CI/CD pipelines.

### Use Cases

- Create automated build, test, and deployment workflows
- Run CI/CD pipelines in a Kubernetes-native way
- Build container images without privileged access
- Implement standardized deployment processes across multiple cloud providers
- Create reusable components for your CI/CD systems

### Estimated Reading Time

15-20 minutes

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster (you can use minikube for local testing)
* Tekton Pipelines installed on your cluster
* kubectl installed and configured to access your cluster
* Tekton CLI (tkn) installed for easier interaction with Tekton resources
  * [Install tkn](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli#installation)

## Process Overview

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Create a "Hello World" Task | Create a basic Task that outputs a greeting message |
| 2 | Create a "Goodbye" Task | Create a second Task that accepts parameters |
| 3 | Create a Pipeline | Create a Pipeline that combines both Tasks in sequence |
| 4 | Run the Pipeline | Execute the Pipeline and view the results |
| 5 | Clean up | Remove the created resources |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a "Hello World" Task

A Task is the basic building block of a Tekton Pipeline. It consists of a series of steps that run sequentially in a container.

1. Create a file named `hello-task.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
  kind: Task
  metadata:
    name: hello
  spec:
    steps:
      - name: echo
        image: ubuntu
        command:
          - echo
        args:
          - "Hello World!"
  ```

  :::tip
  Please replace the `ubuntu` image with an actual accessible image, same below.
  :::

2. Apply the Task to your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f hello-task.yaml
   ```

3. A `TaskRun` object instantiates and executes this Task. Create another file named `hello-world-run.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
  kind: TaskRun
  metadata:
    name: hello-task-run
  spec:
    taskRef:
      name: hello
  ```

4. Apply the `TaskRun` to your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f hello-world-run.yaml
   ```

5. Monitor the TaskRun execution:

   ```bash
   kubectl get taskrun hello-task-run
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   NAME            SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
   hello-task-run  True        Succeeded   1m         2m
   ```

6. Take a look at the logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs --selector=tekton.dev/taskRun=hello-task-run
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   Hello World!
   ```

### Step 2: Create a "Goodbye" Task with Parameters

Now let's create a second Task that accepts parameters to make it more flexible.

1. Create a file named `goodbye-task.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
  kind: Task
  metadata:
    name: goodbye
  spec:
    params:
      - name: username
        type: string
        description: The username to say goodbye to
        default: "World"
    steps:
      - name: goodbye
        image: ubuntu
        command:
          - echo
        args:
          - "Goodbye $(params.username)!"
  ```

2. Apply the Task to your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f goodbye-task.yaml
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Pipeline

A Pipeline defines an ordered series of Tasks arranged in a specific execution order as part of your CI/CD workflow.

1. Create a file named `hello-goodbye-pipeline.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
  kind: Pipeline
  metadata:
    name: hello-goodbye
  spec:
    params:
      - name: username
        type: string
        description: The username to say goodbye to
        default: "World"
    tasks:
      - name: hello
        taskRef:
          name: hello
      - name: goodbye
        runAfter:
          - hello
        taskRef:
          name: goodbye
        params:
          - name: username
            value: "$(params.username)"
  ```

   This Pipeline:
   - Defines a parameter called `username`
   - Includes two Tasks: `hello` and `goodbye`
   - Specifies that `goodbye` should run after `hello` completes
   - Passes the Pipeline parameter to the `goodbye` Task

2. Apply the Pipeline to your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f hello-goodbye-pipeline.yaml
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Pipeline

A PipelineRun is used to execute a Pipeline and provide any required parameters.

1. Create a file named `hello-goodbye-pipeline-run.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
  kind: PipelineRun
  metadata:
    name: hello-goodbye-run
  spec:
    pipelineRef:
      name: hello-goodbye
    params:
      - name: username
        value: "Tekton"
  ```

2. Apply the PipelineRun to your cluster to start the Pipeline:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f hello-goodbye-pipeline-run.yaml
   ```

3. Monitor the Pipeline execution:

  ```bash
  tkn pipelinerun logs hello-goodbye-run -f
  ```

  You should see output similar to:
  ```
  [hello : echo] Hello World!
  [goodbye : goodbye] Goodbye Tekton!
  ```

### Step 5: Clean Up

To remove the resources created in this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl delete -f hello-task.yaml
kubectl delete -f hello-task-run.yaml
kubectl delete -f goodbye-task.yaml
kubectl delete -f hello-goodbye-pipeline.yaml
kubectl delete -f hello-goodbye-pipeline-run.yaml
```
