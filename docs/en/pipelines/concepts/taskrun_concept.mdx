# TaskRuns

A TaskRun is a Kubernetes Custom Resource that instantiates a Task for execution. TaskRuns are responsible for executing the steps defined in a Task and managing their lifecycle, providing a way to run Tasks either standalone or as part of a Pipeline.

## Why TaskRuns are Needed

### CI/CD Execution Challenges

In CI/CD systems, there are several challenges related to task execution:

- **Execution Tracking**: Need to track the progress and status of each task execution
- **Resource Allocation**: Need to allocate appropriate resources for each task
- **Input/Output Management**: Need to manage inputs to and outputs from task executions
- **Error Handling**: Need to handle failures and provide debugging information
- **Auditability**: Need to maintain a record of all task executions for auditing purposes

### Tekton's Solution

Tekton TaskRuns address these challenges by:

- **Execution Instance**: Each TaskRun represents a single execution of a Task with specific inputs
- **Status Tracking**: TaskRuns track the status of each Step's execution
- **Resource Binding**: TaskRuns bind actual resources (volumes, credentials) to Task requirements
- **Result Collection**: TaskRuns collect and store the results produced by Tasks
- **Kubernetes Integration**: TaskRuns leverage Kubernetes for resource management and scheduling

## Advantages

- **Isolation**: Each TaskRun executes independently, allowing parallel execution of the same Task
- **Traceability**: TaskRuns provide detailed execution history and logs
- **Flexibility**: TaskRuns can override Task parameters and workspace bindings
- **Reusability**: The same Task can be executed with different inputs via different TaskRuns
- **Integration**: TaskRuns can be triggered by various systems through Kubernetes API
- **Observability**: TaskRun status and logs can be monitored through Kubernetes tools

## Scenarios

TaskRuns are useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Manual Task Execution**: Running a Task on-demand for testing or debugging
- **Scheduled Operations**: Running Tasks on a schedule for maintenance operations
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Triggering Tasks in response to external events
- **Pipeline Components**: Executing Tasks as part of a larger Pipeline
- **CI/CD Operations**: Building, testing, and deploying applications

## Constraints and Limitations

- TaskRuns execute on a single Kubernetes node and cannot span multiple nodes
- Once started, TaskRun parameters cannot be modified
- TaskRuns have limited retry capabilities for failed Steps
- TaskRun execution time is limited by the Kubernetes pod timeout
- TaskRuns cannot be paused once they start executing

## Principles

### TaskRun Execution Model

When a TaskRun is created:

1. Tekton validates the TaskRun specification
2. Kubernetes creates a Pod for the TaskRun
3. Each Step in the Task becomes a container in the Pod
4. Tekton injects an entrypoint binary into each Step container
5. Steps run sequentially in the order defined in the Task
6. The TaskRun status is updated as each Step completes
7. Results are collected and stored in the TaskRun status
8. The Pod is terminated when all Steps complete or on failure

### TaskRun Status

The TaskRun status provides detailed information about the execution:

1. Overall status (Running, Succeeded, Failed, etc.)
2. Start and completion times
3. Individual Step statuses
4. Task results
5. Reason for failure (if applicable)
6. Pod name for accessing logs

## Configuration Examples

### Basic TaskRun Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-app-run
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  params:
    - name: image
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: app-source-pvc
```

### TaskRun with Embedded Task Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: print-message-run
spec:
  taskSpec:
    params:
      - name: message
        type: string
    steps:
      - name: print
        image: ubuntu
        script: |
          echo "$(params.message)"
  params:
    - name: message
      value: "Hello, Tekton!"
```

## Important Parameters

### Timeout

Timeout allows setting a maximum duration for TaskRun execution.

#### Use Cases

- Preventing long-running Tasks from consuming resources indefinitely
- Ensuring CI/CD pipelines complete within a reasonable timeframe
- Handling hung or deadlocked Tasks

#### Principles

Timeouts are:
- Specified in the TaskRun specification
- Applied to the entire TaskRun execution
- Measured from the start of the first Step to the completion of the last Step
- Result in TaskRun failure if exceeded

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-with-timeout
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  timeout: "10m"
  params:
    - name: image
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

### Resource Limits

Resource limits allow you to specify compute resource requirements and limits for TaskRun execution. The `computeResources` field in the TaskRun specification provides a way to control CPU and memory allocation for the Pod that executes the TaskRun steps.

#### Use Cases

- **Resource Management**: Fair resource allocation across TaskRuns
- **Cost Control**: Prevent excessive resource consumption
- **Performance**: Optimize resource allocation for compute-intensive operations
- **Stability**: Avoid resource exhaustion affecting other workloads

#### Principles

Resource limits:
- Use `computeResources` field in TaskRun specification
- Include `requests` (minimum) and `limits` (maximum)
- Apply to all containers in the TaskRun Pod
- Can be overridden by individual Step specifications
- Follow Kubernetes resource specification format

#### Configuration Examples

**Basic Resource Limits**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-with-resources
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  computeResources:
    requests:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
```

### Pod Template

Pod templates allow customizing the Kubernetes Pod configuration for a TaskRun.
The `podTemplate` field in the TaskRun specification provides a way to configure the underlying Pod that executes the TaskRun steps.

:::tip
For more information about Pod Templates, please refer to [Pod Templates](./pod_templates_concept.mdx).
:::

#### Use Cases

- **Security Configuration**: Setting security contexts to run containers as non-root users
- **Node Selection**: Using node selectors to schedule Pods on specific nodes
- **Tolerations**: Adding tolerations for nodes with taints
- **Service Accounts**: Configuring custom service accounts for Pod execution
- **Volume Configuration**: Adding additional volumes or configuring volume mounts
- **Environment Variables**: Setting environment variables at the Pod level
- **Affinity Rules**: Configuring pod affinity and anti-affinity rules

#### Principles

Pod templates:
- Are applied to the Pod created for the TaskRun
- Can override default Pod configurations set by Tekton
- Allow fine-grained control over Pod execution environment
- Can be used to meet specific security, compliance, or resource requirements
- Support all standard Kubernetes Pod specification fields
- Are merged with Tekton's default Pod configuration

#### Configuration Examples

**Basic Pod Template with Security Context**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-with-pod-template
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1001
      fsGroup: 1001
```

**Pod Template with Node Selector and Resource Limits**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun

      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
  podTemplate:
    nodeSelector:
      disktype: ssd
      environment: production
```

**Pod Template with Tolerations and Affinity**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-with-affinity
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  podTemplate:
    tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "build"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: "kubernetes.io/e2e-az-name"
                  operator: "In"
                  values:
                    - "e2e-az1"
                    - "e2e-az2"
```

**Pod Template with Service Account and Environment Variables**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-with-env
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: build-app
  podTemplate:
    serviceAccountName: build-service-account
    env:
      - name: BUILD_ENVIRONMENT
        value: "production"
      - name: LOG_LEVEL
        value: "debug"
```
