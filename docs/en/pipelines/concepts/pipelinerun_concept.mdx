# PipelineRuns

A PipelineRun is a Kubernetes Custom Resource that instantiates a Pipeline for execution. PipelineRuns are responsible for executing the Tasks defined in a Pipeline and managing their lifecycle, providing a way to run end-to-end CI/CD workflows.

## Why PipelineRuns are Needed

### CI/CD Workflow Challenges

In CI/CD systems, there are several challenges related to workflow execution:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Need to coordinate multiple tasks in a specific order
- **Resource Coordination**: Need to manage resources across multiple tasks
- **Data Sharing**: Need to share data between tasks in a workflow
- **Execution Tracking**: Need to track the progress of the entire workflow
- **Error Handling**: Need to handle failures at both task and workflow levels
- **Auditability**: Need to maintain a record of all workflow executions

### Tekton's Solution

Tekton PipelineRuns address these challenges by:

- **Workflow Instance**: Each PipelineRun represents a single execution of a Pipeline with specific inputs
- **Orchestration**: PipelineRuns manage the execution order of Tasks based on dependencies
- **Resource Binding**: PipelineRuns bind actual resources to Pipeline requirements
- **Status Tracking**: PipelineRuns track the status of each Task's execution
- **Result Propagation**: PipelineRuns enable sharing results between Tasks
- **Kubernetes Integration**: PipelineRuns leverage Kubernetes for resource management and scheduling

## Advantages

- **Isolation**: Each PipelineRun executes independently, allowing parallel execution of the same Pipeline
- **Traceability**: PipelineRuns provide detailed execution history and logs
- **Flexibility**: PipelineRuns can override Pipeline parameters and workspace bindings
- **Reusability**: The same Pipeline can be executed with different inputs via different PipelineRuns
- **Integration**: PipelineRuns can be triggered by various systems through Kubernetes API
- **Observability**: PipelineRun status and logs can be monitored through Kubernetes tools

## Scenarios

PipelineRuns are useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Application CI/CD**: Building, testing, and deploying applications
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provisioning and managing infrastructure
- **Release Management**: Coordinating complex release processes
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Running workflows on a schedule
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Triggering workflows in response to external events

## Constraints and Limitations

- PipelineRuns execute within a single Kubernetes cluster
- Once started, PipelineRun parameters cannot be modified
- PipelineRuns have limited retry capabilities for failed Tasks
- PipelineRun execution time is limited by the Kubernetes pod timeouts
- PipelineRuns cannot be paused once they start executing (except with "finally" tasks)

## Principles

### PipelineRun Execution Model

When a PipelineRun is created:

1. Tekton validates the PipelineRun specification
2. Tekton creates TaskRuns for each Task in the Pipeline
3. TaskRuns are executed based on their dependencies
4. Results from Tasks are collected and can be used by subsequent Tasks
5. The PipelineRun status is updated as each TaskRun completes
6. "Finally" Tasks are executed after all other Tasks complete or fail
7. The PipelineRun completes when all TaskRuns complete

### PipelineRun Status

The PipelineRun status provides detailed information about the execution:

1. Overall status (Running, Succeeded, Failed, etc.)
2. Start and completion times
3. Individual TaskRun statuses
4. Task results
5. Reason for failure (if applicable)
6. TaskRun names for accessing logs

## Configuration Examples

### Basic PipelineRun Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-app-run
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
    - name: deployment-name
      value: my-app
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: app-source-pvc
```

### PipelineRun with Embedded Pipeline Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: simple-pipeline-run
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    params:
      - name: message
        type: string
    tasks:
      - name: print-message
        taskSpec:
          params:
            - name: message
              type: string
          steps:
            - name: print
              image: ubuntu
              script: |
                echo "$(params.message)"
        params:
          - name: message
            value: "$(params.message)"
  params:
    - name: message
      value: "Hello, Tekton Pipeline!"
```

## Important Parameters

### Timeout

Timeout allows setting a maximum duration for PipelineRun execution.

#### Use Cases

- Preventing long-running Pipelines from consuming resources indefinitely
- Ensuring CI/CD workflows complete within a reasonable timeframe
- Handling hung or deadlocked Tasks
- Setting different timeout limits for different phases of pipeline execution

#### Principles

Timeouts are:
- Specified in the PipelineRun specification using the `timeouts` field (the legacy `timeout` field is deprecated)
- Applied to the entire PipelineRun execution or specific sections (tasks, finally)
- Measured from the start of the first Task to the completion of the last Task
- Result in PipelineRun failure if exceeded
- Must follow the constraint: `timeouts.pipeline >= timeouts.tasks + timeouts.finally`
- **Important**: If any sub-field is set to "0", there is no timeout for that section. To set `timeouts.tasks` or `timeouts.finally` to "0", you must also set `timeouts.pipeline` to "0"

#### Timeout Fields

- **pipeline**: Maximum duration for the entire PipelineRun
- **tasks**: Maximum duration for all non-finally tasks
- **finally**: Maximum duration for all finally tasks

#### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Standard timeout configuration**
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-with-timeout
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  timeouts:
    pipeline: "1h"    # Total pipeline timeout
    tasks: "45m"      # Timeout for all regular tasks
    finally: "15m"    # Timeout for finally tasks
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

**Example 2: No timeout for tasks and finally (requires pipeline timeout to be 0)**
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-no-timeout
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  timeouts:
    pipeline: "0"     # No overall timeout
    tasks: "0"        # No timeout for regular tasks
    finally: "0"      # No timeout for finally tasks
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

**Note**:
- Example 1 follows the constraint where `pipeline (1h) >= tasks (45m) + finally (15m)`
- Example 2 shows how to disable timeouts by setting all values to "0"

### ServiceAccount

ServiceAccount allows specifying the Kubernetes ServiceAccount to use for authentication.

#### Use Cases

- Providing credentials for accessing private container registries
- Authenticating with cloud providers
- Authorizing access to Kubernetes resources
- Providing credentials for Git operations

#### Principles

ServiceAccounts:
- Can be specified at the PipelineRun level for all Tasks
- Can be mapped to specific Tasks using taskRunSpecs
- Provide credentials through Kubernetes secrets
- Enable secure access to external resources

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-with-service-account
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  taskRunTemplate:
    serviceAccountName: pipeline-service-account
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

### Pod Template

Pod Template allows specifying a Pod template to use as the basis for the configuration of the Pod that executes each Task.

:::tip
For more information about Pod Templates, please refer to [Pod Templates](./pod_templates_concept.mdx).
:::

#### Use Cases

- Setting node selectors for specific hardware requirements
- Configuring tolerations for dedicated nodes
- Specifying security contexts for enhanced security
- Setting resource limits and requests at the Pod level
- Configuring affinity rules for better resource utilization
- Adding custom annotations or labels to Pods

#### Principles

Pod Templates:
- Are applied to all Tasks in the PipelineRun unless overridden by taskRunSpecs
- Follow Kubernetes Pod template specifications
- Can be overridden by Task-specific configurations in taskRunSpecs
- Enable consistent Pod configuration across all Tasks in a PipelineRun
- Support all standard Kubernetes Pod template fields

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-with-pod-template
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  taskRunTemplate:
    serviceAccountName: default
    # Global Pod template for all Tasks in the PipelineRun
    podTemplate:
      nodeSelector:
        disktype: ssd
        environment: production
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "pipeline"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 2000
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/os
                operator: In
                values:
                - linux
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

### TaskRunSpecs

TaskRunSpecs allow customizing individual TaskRun configurations within a PipelineRun by specifying a list of `PipelineTaskRunSpec` which enables setting `ServiceAccountName`, Pod template, and `Metadata` for each task.

#### Use Cases

- Applying different ServiceAccounts to different Tasks for fine-grained access control
- Setting Task-specific Pod templates to meet different resource or security requirements
- Configuring Task-specific metadata for better organization and tracking
- Overriding global PipelineRun configurations for specific Tasks
- Applying different compute resources or node selectors to different stages of the Pipeline

#### Principles

TaskRunSpecs:
- Override the Pod template set for the entire Pipeline
- Allow fine-grained control over Task execution environments
- Can be used to meet specific security, resource, or scheduling requirements
- Enable different configurations for different stages of the Pipeline
- Support all standard Kubernetes Pod template specifications
- Can be combined with global PipelineRun configurations

#### Configuration Fields

Each TaskRunSpec supports the following fields:

- **pipelineTaskName**: The name of the Pipeline task to apply the configuration to
- **serviceAccountName**: The ServiceAccount to use for this specific Task
- **podTemplate**: Pod template configuration specific to this Task
- **metadata**: Metadata configuration for the TaskRun

#### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Basic TaskRunSpecs with ServiceAccount and Pod Template**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-with-taskrunspecs
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  taskRunSpecs:
    - pipelineTaskName: build
      serviceAccountName: build-service-account
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          disktype: ssd
          environment: build
        tolerations:
        - key: "dedicated"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "build"
    - pipelineTaskName: deploy
      serviceAccountName: deploy-service-account
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          disktype: ssd
          environment: production
        tolerations:
        - key: "dedicated"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "deploy"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

**Example 2: TaskRunSpecs with Advanced Pod Configuration**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: advanced-taskrunspecs
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: multi-stage-pipeline
  taskRunSpecs:
    - pipelineTaskName: build
      serviceAccountName: build-sa
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          gpu: available
          disktype: nvme
        securityContext:
          runAsNonRoot: true
          runAsUser: 1000
    - pipelineTaskName: test
      serviceAccountName: test-sa
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          environment: testing
        tolerations:
        - key: "test-only"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
    - pipelineTaskName: deploy
      serviceAccountName: deploy-sa
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          environment: production
        affinity:
          nodeAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                - key: kubernetes.io/os
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - linux
```

**Example 3: TaskRunSpecs with Metadata Configuration**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: taskrunspecs-with-metadata
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-test-deploy
  taskRunSpecs:
    - pipelineTaskName: build
      serviceAccountName: build-sa
      metadata:
        labels:
          stage: build
          environment: development
        annotations:
          tekton.dev/description: "Build stage with optimized resources"
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          disktype: ssd
    - pipelineTaskName: deploy
      serviceAccountName: deploy-sa
      metadata:
        labels:
          stage: deploy
          environment: production
        annotations:
          tekton.dev/description: "Production deployment stage"
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          environment: production
```

**Example 4: TaskRunSpecs Overriding Global Pod Template**

TaskRunSpecs can override the global Pod template set at the PipelineRun level:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: override-global-template
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-deploy-app
  taskRunTemplate:
    serviceAccountName: default
    # Global Pod template for all Tasks
    podTemplate:
      nodeSelector:
        disktype: ssd
      tolerations:
      - key: "general"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "pipeline"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
  # Task-specific overrides
  taskRunSpecs:
    - pipelineTaskName: build
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          disktype: nvme
          gpu: available
        tolerations:
        - key: "build-only"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
    - pipelineTaskName: deploy
      podTemplate:
        nodeSelector:
          environment: production
        tolerations:
        - key: "deploy-only"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
  params:
    - name: image-name
      value: my-registry/my-app:latest
```

### Workspaces

Workspaces allow sharing data between Tasks in a Pipeline.

#### Use Cases

- Sharing source code between build and test Tasks
- Passing build artifacts to deployment Tasks
- Sharing configuration files across multiple Tasks
- Persisting data between Pipeline executions

#### Principles

Workspaces:
- Are declared in the Pipeline and bound in the PipelineRun
- Can be backed by various volume types (PVC, ConfigMap, Secret, etc.)
- Enable data sharing without direct dependencies
- Support different access modes (ReadOnly, ReadWrite)

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-test-with-workspace
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-test-pipeline
  workspaces:
    - name: source-code
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
    - name: cache
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: build-cache-pvc
```

## PipelineRun Status Management

### Monitoring Execution Status

The status field of a PipelineRun provides detailed information about the execution progress:

```yaml
status:
  completionTime: "2023-05-04T02:19:14Z"
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-05-04T02:19:14Z"
      message: "Tasks Completed: 4, Skipped: 0"
      reason: Succeeded
      status: "True"
      type: Succeeded
  startTime: "2023-05-04T02:00:11Z"
  childReferences:
  - name: build-deploy-app-run-build
    pipelineTaskName: build
    kind: TaskRun
```

### Cancelling a PipelineRun

To cancel a running PipelineRun, update its spec.status field:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-app-run
spec:
  # [...other fields...]
  status: "Cancelled"
```

This immediately terminates all running TaskRuns and does not execute pending Tasks or finally Tasks.

### Gracefully Stopping a PipelineRun

To gracefully stop a PipelineRun, allowing finally Tasks to execute:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: build-deploy-app-run
spec:
  # [...other fields...]
  status: "StoppedRunFinally"
```

This completes currently running Tasks but does not start new ones, except for finally Tasks.
