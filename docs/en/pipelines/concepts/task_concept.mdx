# Tasks

A Task is a collection of Steps that execute sequentially on the same node in Kubernetes. Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of a Tekton CI/CD workflow, allowing you to define a series of operations to be performed in order.

## Why Tasks are Needed

### Traditional CI/CD Challenges

In traditional CI/CD systems, workflow steps are often tightly coupled with the CI/CD platform itself. This creates several challenges:

- **Portability**: Workflows defined in one CI/CD system cannot be easily moved to another
- **Flexibility**: Limited ability to customize execution environments for different steps
- **Scalability**: Difficulty in scaling individual steps based on resource requirements
- **Reusability**: Steps defined for one project are difficult to reuse in other projects

### Tekton's Solution

Tekton Tasks address these challenges by:

- **Container-Based Execution**: Each Step runs in its own container, providing isolation and flexibility
- **Kubernetes Native**: Tasks run as Kubernetes pods, leveraging Kubernetes' scheduling and scaling capabilities
- **Declarative Definition**: Tasks are defined as Kubernetes Custom Resources, making them portable and version-controllable
- **Reusability**: Tasks can be shared and reused across projects and teams

## Advantages

- **Isolation**: Each Step runs in its own container, preventing conflicts between dependencies
- **Portability**: Tasks can run on any Kubernetes cluster without modification
- **Reusability**: Tasks can be shared across teams and projects
- **Scalability**: Tasks leverage Kubernetes' scheduling and resource management
- **Flexibility**: Tasks can be customized with parameters and workspaces
- **Observability**: Task execution can be monitored and logged through Kubernetes

## Scenarios

Tasks are useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Build Operations**: Compiling source code, running unit tests
- **Deployment Operations**: Deploying applications to different environments
- **Validation Operations**: Running security scans, code quality checks
- **Infrastructure Operations**: Provisioning and configuring infrastructure
- **Data Processing**: ETL operations, data validation

## Constraints and Limitations

- Tasks run on a single Kubernetes node and cannot span multiple nodes
- All Steps in a Task share the same pod lifecycle
- Steps in a Task must run sequentially, not in parallel
- Tasks have limited ability to handle conditional execution (use Pipelines for complex conditions)
- Task execution time is limited by the Kubernetes pod timeout

## Principles

### Task Execution Model

When a Task is executed through a TaskRun:

1. Kubernetes creates a Pod for the Task
2. Each Step in the Task becomes a container in the Pod
3. Steps run sequentially in the order defined
4. Tekton injects an entrypoint binary into each Step container
5. The entrypoint ensures Steps run in the correct order
6. Workspaces are mounted as volumes in the Pod
7. Parameters are passed to the Task as environment variables or files
8. Results are stored and made available to subsequent Tasks

### Step Execution

Steps within a Task execute sequentially. Each Step:

1. Runs in its own container
2. Has access to shared workspaces
3. Can access outputs from previous Steps
4. Can produce results for subsequent Steps or Tasks

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Task Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: build
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      description: The workspace containing the source code
  steps:
    - name: build
      image: golang
      workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
      script: |
        go build -o app .
```

### Results

Results allow Tasks to produce output values that can be consumed by other Tasks.

#### Use Cases

- Passing build version information
- Sharing generated artifacts paths
- Communicating test results
- Passing deployment URLs

#### Principles

Results are:
- Declared in the Task specification
- Written to a specific file path by the Task
- Read by Tekton after Task completion
- Made available to subsequent Tasks in a Pipeline

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: generate-version
spec:
  results:
    - name: version
      description: The generated version number
  steps:
    - name: generate
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        echo "1.0.$(date +%s)" | tee $(results.version.path)
```

## Important Parameters

### Workspaces

Workspaces allow Tasks to share data with each other and provide a way to access persistent volumes.

#### Use Cases

- Sharing source code between Tasks
- Storing build artifacts
- Sharing configuration files
- Persisting data between Task runs

#### Principles

Workspaces are:
- Declared in the Task specification
- Bound to actual storage when creating a TaskRun
- Mounted at the specified path in each Step container
- Can be shared between multiple Tasks in a Pipeline

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: build
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      description: The workspace containing the source code
      optional: true
  steps:
    - name: build
      image: golang
      workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
      script: |
        go build -o app .
```
