# Introduction

## What is Tekton Pipeline?

Tekton Pipeline is a core component of Tekton that provides Kubernetes-native CI/CD solutions. It allows users to define and run automated workflows as a series of steps, tasks, and pipelines, all running as containers on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Core Features

1. **Declarative Pipeline Definition**
   - Define pipelines using Kubernetes Custom Resources
   - Compose complex workflows from reusable tasks
   - Support for conditional execution and parallel processing

2. **Resource Management**
   - Efficient handling of inputs and outputs
   - Support for workspaces to share data between tasks
   - Parameter passing between pipeline components

3. **Extensibility and Flexibility**
   - Custom task definitions
   - Integration with various tools and platforms
   - Support for matrix-based execution

4. **Kubernetes Native**
   - Runs entirely on Kubernetes
   - Leverages Kubernetes security and scaling capabilities
   - Follows Kubernetes resource management patterns

## How It Works

Tekton Pipeline operates with the following core components:

1. **Task**
   - Defines a series of steps to be executed sequentially
   - Runs in isolated containers within a Kubernetes pod
   - Can define inputs, outputs, and resource requirements

2. **TaskRun**
   - Instantiates and executes a Task
   - Provides runtime parameters and resources
   - Tracks execution status and results

3. **Pipeline**
   - Defines an ordered series of Tasks
   - Specifies execution order and dependencies
   - Manages data flow between Tasks

4. **PipelineRun**
   - Instantiates and executes a Pipeline
   - Provides runtime parameters and resources
   - Tracks overall pipeline execution status

5. **Workspaces**
   - Provides shared storage between Tasks
   - Supports various storage backends (PVC, ConfigMap, etc.)
   - Enables data persistence across Task executions

## Use Cases

Tekton Pipeline is suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Automated build and test processes
   - Deployment automation
   - Release management

2. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Automated infrastructure provisioning
   - Configuration management
   - Environment setup and teardown

3. **Application Lifecycle Management**
   - Automated testing
   - Security scanning
   - Performance testing

## Key Advantages

1. **Reusability**
   - Modular task definitions
   - Shareable pipeline components
   - Standardized workflows

2. **Portability**
   - Kubernetes-native design
   - Container-based execution
   - Platform-agnostic workflows

3. **Scalability**
   - Leverages Kubernetes scaling
   - Parallel task execution
   - Resource-efficient execution

4. **Observability**
   - Detailed execution logs
   - Status tracking
   - Integration with monitoring tools
