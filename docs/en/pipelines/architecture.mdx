# Architecture

## Architecture Overview

Tekton Pipelines is a Kubernetes-based CI/CD system that provides a set of standard Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and run CI/CD workflows as a series of steps. It's designed to be cloud-native, scalable, and extensible.

## Core Components

### 1. Task

A Task is the basic building block of Tekton Pipelines:

- Defines a series of steps to execute
- Runs in a Kubernetes Pod
- Can accept inputs and produce outputs
- Executes steps in sequence

Main characteristics:

- Each step runs in its own container
- Steps share workspace volumes
- Supports parameterization
- Can define resource requirements

### 2. TaskRun

TaskRun is a runtime instance of a Task:

- Creates a Pod to execute the Task
- Manages the lifecycle of the Task execution
- Collects and stores execution results
- Handles resource allocation

Workflow:

1. Creates a Pod with containers for each step
2. Executes steps in sequence
3. Manages shared volumes between steps
4. Collects execution results and status

### 3. Pipeline

Pipeline defines a series of Tasks to be executed:

- Orchestrates multiple Tasks
- Defines execution order and dependencies
- Manages data flow between Tasks
- Supports conditional execution

Key features:

- Task dependency management
- Parameter passing between Tasks
- Workspace sharing across Tasks
- Conditional execution using `when` expressions
- Parallel execution with `runAfter`

### 4. PipelineRun

PipelineRun is a runtime instance of a Pipeline:

- Creates TaskRuns for each Task in the Pipeline
- Manages the execution flow
- Handles resource allocation
- Collects and stores execution results

Main responsibilities:

- Orchestrating TaskRun creation
- Managing execution order
- Handling parameter passing
- Tracking overall execution status

### 5. Workspaces

Workspaces provide a mechanism for sharing data:

- Shared storage between Tasks
- Support for various volume types
- Flexible mounting options
- Persistent data across Task executions

Types of storage supported:

- PersistentVolumeClaims
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- EmptyDir volumes
- CSI (Container Storage Interface) volumes
- Projected volumes

## Workflow

1. **Pipeline Definition**
   - Define Tasks with steps
   - Define Pipeline with Task dependencies
   - Configure parameters and workspaces

2. **Pipeline Execution**
   - Create a PipelineRun resource
   - Controller creates TaskRuns based on dependencies
   - TaskRuns create Pods to execute steps
   - Results are collected and status is updated

3. **Data Flow**
   - Parameters pass data between Pipeline components
   - Workspaces share files between Tasks
   - Results from Tasks can be used in subsequent Tasks

4. **Completion**
   - All TaskRuns complete
   - PipelineRun status is updated
   - Results are stored and available for retrieval

## Deployment Architecture

### Controller Components

1. **Tekton Pipeline Controller**
   - Watches for Tekton CRD instances
   - Creates and manages Kubernetes resources
   - Handles lifecycle management
   - Updates status information

2. **Tekton Webhook**
   - Validates Tekton resources
   - Applies defaults
   - Ensures resource consistency

3. **Tekton Remote Resolvers**
   - Resolves Task and Pipeline definitions from remote sources
   - Supports OCI bundles
   - Supports Git-based resolution
   - Supports HTTP-based resolution

### Runtime Components

1. **TaskRun Pods**
   - Container for each step
   - Init containers for setup
   - Shared volumes for workspaces
   - Sidecars for special functionality

2. **Resource Management**
   - Pod scheduling
   - Resource requests and limits
   - Node selection and affinity
   - Priority classes

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Mechanisms

1. **Service Account Integration**
   - TaskRuns and PipelineRuns use ServiceAccounts
   - Supports Kubernetes RBAC
   - Secret management for credentials

### Authorization Control

1. **Resource Access Control**
   - Role-based access control
   - Namespace isolation
   - Resource quotas

2. **Execution Security**
   - Pod security contexts
   - Network policies
   - Secure workspace handling

## Extensibility Design

### 1. Custom Tasks

- Extend beyond container execution
- Custom resource implementations
- Integration with external systems

### 2. Remote Resolution

- Remote Task and Pipeline definitions
- Support for OCI bundles
- Git-based resolution
- HTTP-based resolution

### 3. Results and Metrics

- Task and Pipeline results
- Execution metrics
- Integration with observability systems
- Custom result processors
