# TektonPipeline

TektonPipeline is a custom resource provided by the Tekton Operator that allows you to install, update, and manage Tekton Pipelines in your Kubernetes cluster. It provides a declarative way to configure and maintain your Tekton Pipeline components without manually applying manifests.

## Terminology Explanation

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TektonPipeline | A custom resource that manages the lifecycle of Tekton Pipeline components in a Kubernetes cluster. |
| Tekton Operator | A Kubernetes operator that manages Tekton components including Pipeline, Triggers, Dashboard, and more. |
| targetNamespace | The namespace where Tekton Pipeline components will be installed. |
| Pipeline Controller | The main controller that processes Pipeline and Task resources. |
| Webhook | A component that validates Tekton Pipeline resources before they are persisted to the cluster. |

## Why We Need TektonPipeline

### The Challenge of Managing Tekton Components

Manually installing and maintaining Tekton Pipeline components involves:

- Applying multiple manifests for different components
- Keeping track of component versions and their compatibility
- Managing upgrades and rollbacks safely
- Configuring components consistently across environments
- Handling custom configurations for specific deployments

This approach leads to:
- Complex management procedures
- Potential for misconfiguration
- Difficulty in tracking the deployed state
- Challenges in implementing consistent upgrades

### How TektonPipeline Addresses These Problems

The TektonPipeline resource provides a declarative, Kubernetes-native way to:

1. **Simplify installation**: Install all Pipeline components with a single resource
2. **Centralize configuration**: Manage all component settings in one place
3. **Automate upgrades**: Easily upgrade to new versions by updating the resource
4. **Ensure consistency**: Apply the same configuration across different environments
5. **Support customization**: Customize Pipeline components based on specific requirements

This approach enables better management of Tekton Pipeline components while maintaining the flexibility to customize as needed.

## Advantages

- **Simplified management**: Single resource to manage all Pipeline components
- **Declarative configuration**: Define the desired state and let the operator handle implementation details
- **Version control**: Easy tracking of configuration changes through GitOps practices
- **Automated reconciliation**: Operator ensures the actual state matches the desired state
- **Configuration validation**: Built-in validation of configuration parameters
- **Streamlined upgrades**: Simplified process for upgrading to new versions
- **Kubernetes-native**: Integrates seamlessly with the Kubernetes ecosystem

## Applicable Scenarios

TektonPipeline is essential in the following scenarios:

1. **Initial Deployment**: Setting up Tekton Pipeline in a new Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Configuration Management**: Managing Pipeline configuration changes over time.

3. **Version Upgrades**: Upgrading Tekton Pipeline to newer versions.

4. **Multi-Cluster Deployments**: Ensuring consistent Pipeline deployment across multiple clusters.

5. **Custom Deployments**: Implementing specific Pipeline configurations for different environments.

6. **GitOps Workflows**: Including Pipeline configuration in GitOps deployment processes.

## Constraints and Limitations

- Requires the Tekton Operator to be installed in the cluster
- Some advanced configurations may require other Tekton Operator resources
- Changes to certain fields may require component restarts
- Must follow Kubernetes resource management principles

## Principles

    deployments: {}
```

### Key Components and Their Relationships

1. **targetNamespace**: Where Tekton Pipeline components will be installed
   - Default is "tekton-pipelines"
   - All Pipeline components will be created in this namespace
   - Make sure you have permissions to create resources in this namespace

2. **version**: The version of Tekton Pipeline to install
   - Can specify a specific version like "v0.45.0"
   - Omitting this field will install the latest version supported by the operator

3. **Feature flags**: Many configuration options to control Pipeline behavior
   - `disable-affinity-assistant`: Controls affinity assistant behavior
   - `disable-creds-init`: Controls credential initialization
   - `enable-api-fields`: Controls which API fields are enabled
   - `enable-custom-tasks`: Enables the use of custom tasks
   - And many more as shown in the full structure above

4. **performance**: Settings for high-availability and performance tuning
   - `replicas`: Number of controller replicas
   - `buckets`: Number of buckets for the controller
   - `threads-per-controller`: Number of worker threads per controller
   - `statefulset-ordinals`: Enables StatefulSet Ordinals mode

## Important Parameter Explanations Related to TektonPipeline

### Feature Flags

Feature flags control specific behaviors of the Pipeline controller.

#### Applicable Scenarios

- Disabling the affinity assistant for performance reasons
- Enabling or disabling specific Pipeline features
- Configuring environment-specific settings

#### Constraints and Limitations

- Some feature flags might be deprecated in future versions
- Changing certain flags may require pipeline reruns
- Compatibility considerations between different flags

#### Principles/Parameter Explanation

Common feature flags include:

- **disable-affinity-assistant** (Default: `false`): Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton from creating an Affinity Assistant for every TaskRun sharing a PVC workspace.

- **disable-creds-init** (Default: `false`): Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton scanning attached service accounts and injecting any credentials it finds into your Steps.

- **await-sidecar-readiness** (Default: `true`): Controls whether to wait for sidecar containers to be running before starting a TaskRun's first step.

- **running-in-environment-with-injected-sidecars** (Default: `true`): Should be set to false when Pipelines is running in a cluster that does not use injected sidecars such as Istio.

- **enable-custom-tasks** (Default: `false`): Enables the use of custom tasks from within pipelines.

### Metrics Properties

Metrics properties control how metrics are collected and reported.

#### Applicable Scenarios

- Setting up monitoring for Tekton pipelines
- Customizing metric collection behavior
- Integrating with observability systems

#### Configuration Examples

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonPipeline
metadata:
  name: pipeline
spec:
  targetNamespace: tekton-pipelines
  metrics.pipelinerun.duration-type: histogram
  metrics.pipelinerun.level: pipeline
  metrics.taskrun.duration-type: histogram
