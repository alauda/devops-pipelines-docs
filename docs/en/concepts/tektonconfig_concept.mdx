# TektonConfig

TektonConfig is the top-level custom resource provided by the Tekton Operator that enables users to install, configure, and manage all Tekton components from a single control point. It provides a unified approach to Tekton ecosystem management within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Terminology Explanation

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TektonConfig | The primary custom resource for managing all Tekton components through the Operator. |
| TektonPipeline | Component that provides the core pipeline functionality for defining and running CI/CD workflows. |
| TektonTrigger | Component that allows events to trigger pipeline executions. |
| TektonChain | Component that provides supply chain security features like signing and verification. |
| TektonHub | Component that hosts a catalog of reusable Tasks and Pipelines. |
| TektonResult | Component that stores and enables querying of TaskRun and PipelineRun results. |
| Profile | Configuration option that determines which components to install. |
| Target Namespace | The namespace where Tekton components will be installed. |
| Pruner | Feature that cleans up completed TaskRuns and PipelineRuns to manage cluster resources. |

## Why We Need TektonConfig

### The Challenge of Managing Tekton Components

Without TektonConfig, managing Tekton components in a Kubernetes cluster requires:

- Manual installation and configuration of each component separately
- Individual management of component versions and compatibility
- Custom scripting to handle upgrades and configuration changes
- Separate maintenance of each component's configuration
- Complex coordination of inter-component dependencies

This approach leads to:
- Increased operational complexity
- Higher risk of configuration errors
- Difficulty maintaining version compatibility
- Time-consuming upgrades and changes
- Inconsistent configuration across environments

### How TektonConfig Addresses These Problems

TektonConfig provides a unified, declarative approach to:

1. **Install multiple components**: Deploy Pipelines, Triggers, and other components from a single resource
2. **Ensure compatibility**: The Operator manages version compatibility between components
3. **Centralize configuration**: Configure all components through a single specification
4. **Simplify upgrades**: Update component versions by changing a single resource
5. **Standardize management**: Use consistent patterns for all components
6. **Enable platform-specific features**: Configure features specific to Kubernetes or OpenShift seamlessly

This centralized approach significantly reduces operational complexity and ensures consistent configuration across environments.

## Advantages

- **Simplified management**: Control all Tekton components through a single resource
- **Reduced operational overhead**: The Operator handles installation, configuration, and upgrades
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent configuration across all components
- **Version compatibility**: The Operator ensures that component versions work together
- **Platform-aware**: Provides platform-specific features for Kubernetes and OpenShift
- **Declarative configuration**: Use Kubernetes-native approaches to manage the entire Tekton stack
- **Reduced error risk**: Centralized validation prevents misconfigurations
- **Resource cleanup**: Built-in pruner functionality to manage cluster resources

## Applicable Scenarios

TektonConfig is essential in the following scenarios:

1. **Production CI/CD Environments**: Simplify management of production-grade Tekton installations.
2. **Multi-tenant Clusters**: Configure and isolate Tekton components in shared environments.
3. **Enterprise Deployments**: Ensure consistent configuration across multiple clusters.
4. **Regulated Environments**: Maintain and verify specific configurations for compliance.
5. **Automated Infrastructure**: Use GitOps approaches to manage Tekton components.
6. **Complex CI/CD Workflows**: Coordinate multiple Tekton components for comprehensive pipelines.

## Constraints and Limitations

- Requires cluster-level permissions to install and manage components
- Some configurations may be platform-specific (Kubernetes vs. OpenShift)
- Changes to the TektonConfig resource can trigger redeployments of components
- Some advanced configurations may still require direct interaction with component-specific resources
- Upgrades between major versions may require additional steps

## Principles

### TektonConfig Structure

A TektonConfig resource has the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  # Profile determines which components to install
  profile: all  # Options: lite, basic, all

  # Target namespace for the Tekton components
  targetNamespace: tekton-pipelines

  config:
    nodeSelector:
      key: value
    tolerations:
    - key: "key1"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "value1"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    priorityClassName: system-node-critical

  # Component-specific configurations
  pipeline:
    disable-affinity-assistant: false
    disable-creds-init: false
    enable-api-fields: alpha
    enable-tekton-oci-bundles: true
    performance:
      disable-ha: false
      buckets: 1
      threads-per-controller: 2
    pruner:
      resources:
        - taskrun
        - pipelinerun
      schedule: "0 8 * * *"
      keep: 100
      keep-since: 43200

  trigger:
    enable-api-fields: stable

  hub:
    params:
      - name: enable-devconsole-integration
        value: "false"

  results:
    enable: false

  chain:
    enable: false
```

### Key Components and Their Relationships

1. **Profile**: Determines which components to install
   - **lite**: Installs only the basic Pipeline controller
   - **basic**: Installs Pipeline and Triggers controllers
   - **all**: Installs all available components

2. **targetNamespace**: The namespace where components will be installed
   - Default is typically `tekton-pipelines`
   - All components are installed in this namespace

3. **Component Configurations**: Specific settings for each component
   - **pipeline**: Configuration for the Pipeline controller
   - **trigger**: Configuration for the Triggers controller
   - **hub**: Configuration for Tekton Hub
   - **results**: Configuration for Tekton Results
   - **chain**: Configuration for Tekton Chains

4. **Pruner**: Configuration for automatic cleanup of resources
   - **resources**: Which resources to clean up (TaskRuns, PipelineRuns)
   - **schedule**: Cron schedule for cleanup jobs
   - **keep**: Number of resources to retain
   - **keep-since**: Duration in seconds to retain resources

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig

  targetNamespace: tekton-pipelines

  pipeline:
    enable-api-fields: stable
    performance:
      disable-ha: false
      buckets: 3
      threads-per-controller: 2
    pruner:
      resources:
        - taskrun
        - pipelinerun
      schedule: "0 1 * * *"
      keep: 500
      keep-since: 172800  # 48 hours

  trigger:
    enable-api-fields: stable

  hub:
    enable: true

  results:
    enable: true

  chain:
    enable: true
```
