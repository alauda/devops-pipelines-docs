# Image Signature Verification

In Tekton Chains, it can automatically sign the built image and record the signature in the SLSA Provenance.

## Feature Overview

This method uses Tekton Chains to automatically sign the built image and then use cosign or Kyverno to verify the signature:

1. Configure Tekton Chains to automatically sign the built image.
2. Use `buildah` Tekton Task to build the image.
3. (Optional) Use `cosign` cli to verify the signature.
4. Configure Kyverno rules to allow only signed images.
5. Use the image to create a Pod to verify the signature.

:::tip
Compared to [Quick Start: Signed Provenance](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx), this method only adds more verification steps.
:::

## Use Cases

The following scenarios require referring to the guidance in this document:

- Implementing image signature verification in Kubernetes clusters using Kyverno
- Enforcing security policies to only allow signed images to be deployed
- Setting up automated image signature verification in CI/CD pipelines
- Ensuring image integrity and authenticity in production environments
- Implementing supply chain security controls for container images

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Chains and Kyverno installed
- A registry with image pushing enabled
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured to access your cluster
- `cosign` CLI tool installed
- `jq` CLI tool installed

## Process Overview

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate signing keys | Create a key pair for signing artifacts using cosign |
| 2 | Set up authentication | Configure registry credentials for image pushing |
| 3 | Configure Tekton Chains | Set up Chains to use OCI storage and configure signing |
| 4 | Create a sample pipeline | Create a pipeline definition with necessary tasks and workspaces |
| 5 | Run a sample pipeline | Create and run a PipelineRun with proper configuration |
| 6 | Wait for signing | Wait for the PipelineRun to be signed by Chains |
| 7 | Get image information | Extract image URI and digest from the PipelineRun |
| 8 | Verify signatures with Kyverno | Configure and verify the image signature using Kyverno policies |
| 9 | Clean up resources | Delete the test Pods and policies |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Steps 1-7: Basic Setup

These steps are identical to the [Quick Start: Signed Provenance](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx) guide. Please follow the instructions in that guide for:

- [Step 1: Generate Signing Keys](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-1-generate-signing-keys)
- [Step 2: Set up Authentication](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-2-set-up-authentication)
- [Step 3: Configure Tekton Chains](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-3-configure-tekton-chains)
- [Step 4: Create a Sample Pipeline](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-4-create-a-sample-pipeline)
- [Step 5: Run a Sample Pipeline](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-5-run-a-sample-pipeline)
- [Step 6: Wait for the PipelineRun to be signed](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-6-wait-for-the-pipelinerun-to-be-signed)
- [Step 7: Get the image from the PipelineRun](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-7-get-the-image-from-the-pipelinerun)

### Step 8: Verify the signature with Kyverno

At [Step 8: Verifying the Image and Attestation](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-8-verifying-the-image-and-attestation), we use `cosign` CLI to verify the signature.
Here we use Kyverno to verify the signature.

#### Step 8.1: Create a Kyverno policy to allow only signed images to be deployed

:::tip
This step requires cluster administrator privileges.

More details about Kyverno ClusterPolicy, please refer to [Kyverno ClusterPolicy](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/)
:::

The policy is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: only-cosign-image-deploy
spec:
  webhookConfiguration:
    failurePolicy: Fail
    timeoutSeconds: 30
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: check-image
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
                - Pod
              namespaces:
                - policy
      verifyImages:
        - imageReferences:
            - "*"
            # - "<registry>/test/*"
          skipImageReferences:
            - "ghcr.io/trusted/*"
          failureAction: Enforce
          verifyDigest: false
          required: false
          useCache: false
          imageRegistryCredentials:
            allowInsecureRegistry: true
            secrets:
              # The credential needs to exist in the namespace where kyverno is deployed
              - registry-credentials

          attestors:
            - count: 1
              entries:
                - keys:
                    publicKeys: |- # <- The public key of the signer
                      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

                      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

                    ctlog:
                      ignoreSCT: true

                    rekor:
                      ignoreTlog: true
```

:::

**Need to adjust the configuration**

- `spec.rules[].attestors[].entries[].keys.publicKeys`: The public key of the signer.
  - This public key is the same as the public key `cosign.pub` in the `signing-secrets` secret.
  - The public key can be obtained from the [Get the Signing Public Key](../configure/signing_key_configuration.mdx#get-the-signing-public-key) section.

Save into a yaml file named `kyverno.only-cosign-image-deploy.yaml` and apply it with:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f kyverno.only-cosign-image-deploy.yaml

clusterpolicy.kyverno.io/only-cosign-image-deploy configured
```

#### Step 8.2: Verify the policy

In the `policy` namespace where the policy is defined, create a Pod to verify the policy.

Use the signed image created by the pipeline to create a Pod.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ export IMAGE=<<registry>/test/chains/demo-1:latest@sha256:93635f39cb31de5c6988cdf1f10435c41b3fb85570c930d51d41bbadc1a90046>

$ kubectl run -n $NAMESPACE signed --image=${IMAGE} -- sleep 3600

pod/signed created
```

The Pod will be created successfully.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ kubectl get pod -n $NAMESPACE signed

NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
signed   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

Use the unsigned image to create a Pod.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ export IMAGE=<<registry>/test/chains/unsigned:latest>

$ kubectl run -n $NAMESPACE unsigned --image=${IMAGE} -- sleep 3600
```

Receive the output like this, means the Pod is blocked by the policy.

```text
Error from server: admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/policy/unsigned was blocked due to the following policies

only-cosign-image-deploy:
  check-image: 'failed to verify image ubuntu:latest:
    .attestors[0].entries[0].keys: no signatures found'
```

### Step 9: Clean up the resources

Delete the Pods created in the previous steps.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ kubectl delete pod -n $NAMESPACE signed

pod "signed" deleted
```

Delete the policy.

```shell
$ kubectl delete clusterpolicy only-cosign-image-deploy
```

## Expected Results

After completing this guide:

- You have a working setup with Tekton Chains for image signing and Kyverno for signature verification
- Your container images are automatically signed during the build process
- Only signed images can be deployed in the specified namespace
- Unsigned images are automatically blocked by Kyverno policies
- You have implemented a basic supply chain security control for your container images

This guide provides a foundation for implementing supply chain security in your CI/CD pipelines. In a production environment, you should:

1. Configure proper namespace isolation and access controls
2. Implement secure key management for signing keys
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for policy violations
4. Regularly rotate signing keys and update security policies
5. Consider implementing additional security controls like vulnerability scanning
