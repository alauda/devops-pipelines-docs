# License Compliance Verification

In ACP (Alauda Container Platform), you can use `trivy` or `syft` task in Tekton Pipeline to generate the SBOM for image.

The SBOM contains license information for each component in the image.
We can use Kyverno policies to reject images that include specific licenses.

Since the SBOM has been generated for the image in [Base Image and SBOM Verification](./sbom_verification.mdx), we will not create a pipeline here, but directly use the existing image to verify this capability.

:::tip
This chapter is based on [Base Image and SBOM Verification](./sbom_verification.mdx), only adds the logic to validate the license information of the image.
:::

## Feature Overview

This method is similar to [Base Image and SBOM Verification](./sbom_verification.mdx), only change the kyverno rules to verify the license compliance.

1. Configure Kyverno rules to verify the SBOM.
2. Use the image to create a Pod to verify the license compliance.

## Use Cases

The following scenarios require referring to the guidance in this document:

- Implementing license compliance verification in Kubernetes clusters using Kyverno
- Enforcing security policies to block images containing specific licenses (e.g., GPL)
- Setting up automated license verification in CI/CD pipelines
- Ensuring license compliance in production environments
- Implementing supply chain security controls for container images by verifying their component licenses

## Prerequisites

- [Base Image and SBOM Verification](./sbom_verification.mdx) is completed.

## Process Overview

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Verify license information | Create and apply Kyverno policy to verify component licenses |
| 2 | (Optional) Verify CVE check | Add conditions to check specific vulnerabilities in the policy |
| 3 | Clean up | Delete test resources and policies |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Steps 1: Verify the license information of the image

#### Step 1.1: Create a Kyverno policy to verify the base image information

:::tip
This step requires cluster administrator privileges.

More details about Kyverno ClusterPolicy, please refer to [Kyverno ClusterPolicy](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/)
:::

The policy is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: verify-component-licenses
spec:
  webhookConfiguration:
    failurePolicy: Fail
    timeoutSeconds: 30

              namespaces:
                - policy
      verifyImages:
        - imageReferences:
            - "*"
            # - "<registry>/test/*"
          skipImageReferences:
            - "ghcr.io/trusted/*"
          failureAction: Enforce
          verifyDigest: false
          required: false
          useCache: false
          imageRegistryCredentials:
            allowInsecureRegistry: true
            secrets:
              # The credential needs to exist in the namespace where kyverno is deployed
              - registry-credentials

          attestations:
            - type: https://cyclonedx.org/bom
              attestors:
                - entries:
                    - attestor:
                      keys:
                        publicKeys: |- # <- The public key of the signer

                          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

                        ctlog:
                          ignoreSCT: true

                        rekor:
                          ignoreTlog: true

              conditions:
                - any:
                    # Check if the image contains specific licenses
                    - key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.id }}"
                      operator: AllNotIn
                      value: ["GPL-3.0-only", "GPL-3.0-or-later"]
                      message: |
                        The image contains GPL licenses which are not allowed.
                        Found licenses: {{ components[].licenses[].license.id }}

                    # Check if the image contains specific license names
                    - key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.name }}"
                      operator: AllNotIn
                      value: ["GPL"]
                      message: |
                        The image contains Expat license which is not allowed.
                        Found licenses: {{ components[].licenses[].license.name }}
```

:::details{title="Explanation of YAML fields"}
- The policy is largely consistent with the one in [Image Signature Verification](../how_to/image_signature_verification.mdx#step-81-create-a-kyverno-policy-to-allow-only-signed-images-to-be-deployed)
- `spec.rules[0].verifyImages[].attestations[0].conditions`
  - `type`: The cyclonedx SBOM attestation type is `https://cyclonedx.org/bom`
  - `attestors`: the same as above.
  - `conditions`: The conditions to be verified.
    - `any`: Any of the conditions must be met.
      - `key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.id }}"`: The image contains GPL licenses which are not allowed.
      - `key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.name }}"`: The image contains Expat license which is not allowed.
:::

Save the policy to a yaml file named `kyverno.verify-component-licenses.yaml` and apply it with:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f kyverno.verify-component-licenses.yaml

clusterpolicy.kyverno.io/verify-component-licenses created
```

#### Step 1.2: Verify the policy

In the `policy` namespace where the policy is defined, create a Pod to verify the policy.

Use the built image to create a Pod.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ export IMAGE=<<registry>/test/chains/demo-5:latest@sha256:a6c727554be7f9496e413a789663060cd2e62b3be083954188470a94b66239c7>

$ kubectl run -n $NAMESPACE component-licenses --image=${IMAGE} -- sleep 3600
```

If your image contains GPL licenses, the Pod will be created failed.

Receive the output like this:

```text
Error from server: admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/policy/high-risk was blocked due to the following policies

verify-component-licenses:
  check-image: |
    image attestations verification failed, verifiedCount: 0, requiredCount: 1, error: .attestations[0].attestors[0].entries[0].keys: attestation checks failed for <registry>/test/chains/demo-5:latest and predicate https://cyclonedx.org/bom: The image contains GPL licenses which are not allowed.
    Found licenses: ["GPL-3.0-only","GPL-3.0-or-later","Latex2e"]
    ; The image contains Expat license which is not allowed.
    Found licenses: [,"GPL","LGPL","public-domain"]
```

Change the license limit in the `ClusterPolicy` to allow GPL licenses.

```yaml
conditions:
  - any:
    - key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.id }}"
      operator: AllNotIn
      value: ["GPL-8.0-only"]
      message: |
        The image contains GPL licenses which are not allowed.
        Found licenses: {{ components[].licenses[].license.id }}

    - key: "{{ components[].licenses[].license.name }}"
      operator: AllNotIn
      value: ["GPL-x"]
      message: |
        The image contains Expat license which is not allowed.
        Found licenses: {{ components[].licenses[].license.name }}
```

Then create a Pod to verify the policy.

```shell
$ kubectl run -n $NAMESPACE component-licenses --image=${IMAGE} -- sleep 3600

pod/component-licenses created
```

The Pod will be created successfully.

### Step 2: (Optional) Verify Image Check CVE-2022-42889

:::tip
- If you interested to add more conditions to the policy, you can continue to read the following content.
- This is a simple example, you can use the same method to check other vulnerabilities.
:::

CVE-2022-42889 is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Commons Text library which could lead to arbitrary code executions and occurs in versions 1.5 through 1.9. Detecting the affected package may be done in an SBOM by identifying the "commons-text" package with one of the affected versions. This policy checks attested SBOMs in CycloneDX format of an image specified under `imageReferences` and denies it if it contains versions 1.5-1.9 of the commons-text package.

We only need to add a condition to the `ClusterPolicy` to check if the `commons-text` package is in the image.

```yaml
conditions:
  - all:
    - key: "{{ components[?name=='commons-text'].version || 'none' }}"
      operator: AllNotIn
      value: ["1.5","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"]
```

This is not demonstrated here, interested readers can try it themselves.

### Step 3: Clean up the resources

Delete the Pods created in the previous steps.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<policy>
$ kubectl delete pod -n $NAMESPACE component-licenses
```

Delete the policy.

```shell
$ kubectl delete clusterpolicy verify-component-licenses
```

## Expected Results

After completing this guide:

- You have a working setup with Kyverno for license compliance verification
- Your container images automatically include SBOM information in their attestations
- Only images with acceptable licenses can be deployed in the specified namespace
- Images with non-compliant licenses are automatically blocked by Kyverno policies
- You have implemented a basic supply chain security control by verifying the license information of components in your container images

This guide provides a foundation for implementing license compliance verification in your CI/CD pipelines. In a production environment, you should:

1. Configure proper namespace isolation and access controls
2. Implement secure key management for signing keys
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for policy violations
4. Regularly update security policies based on your license requirements
