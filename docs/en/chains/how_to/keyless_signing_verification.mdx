# (Optional) Keyless Signing Verification

:::tip
- If you interested about the keyless signing verification, you can continue to read the following content.
- The content in this chapter needs to be able to access the public network.
- But you can use the private Rekor services if you have already deployed them.
:::

:::note
- **This method requires the environment to access the Internet.**
- If you have deployed private [Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor) services, you can also use these capabilities by adjusting the related configurations.
- About deploying private [Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor) services is not in the scope of this document, please refer to the relevant documentation.
:::

While ACP (Alauda Container Platform) currently does not provide the capability to deploy private Rekor instances, it does offer integration capabilities with Rekor services.

Here, we take the integration of public Rekor as an example to introduce how to use these services.
If you have already deployed private Rekor services, please refer to the relevant documentation for configuration.

## Feature Overview

This method uses transparency logs to enhance security by eliminating the need for key management:

1. Configure Tekton Chains to use keyless signing.
2. Use `buildah` Tekton Task to build the image.
3. Configure Kyverno rules to verify the keyless signature.
4. Use the image to create a Pod to verify the keyless signature.

## Use Cases

The following scenarios require referring to the guidance in this document:

- Implementing keyless signing and verification for container images in Kubernetes clusters
- Enforcing security policies to verify image signatures without managing signing keys
- Setting up automated transparency log verification in CI/CD pipelines
- Ensuring image provenance and integrity through Rekor transparency logs
- Implementing supply chain security controls by verifying image signatures against public Rekor services

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Chains and Kyverno installed
- A registry with image pushing enabled
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured to access your cluster
- `cosign` CLI tool installed
- `jq` CLI tool installed
- `curl` installed
- [rekor-cli](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/releases) installed
  - Used to verify and interact with attestations stored in the Rekor transparency log server.

## Process Overview

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate Signing Keys | Create a key pair for signing artifacts using cosign |
| 2 | Set up Authentication | Configure registry credentials for image pushing |
| 3 | Configure Tekton Chains | Set up Chains to use OCI storage and configure signing |
| 4 | Re-run Pipeline | Trigger a new pipeline run to generate transparency log entries |
| 5 | Get Rekor Log Index | Extract the Rekor log index from PipelineRun annotations |
| 6 | Verify Rekor Signature | Use curl to retrieve and verify the Rekor signature |
| 7 | Use Rekor CLI | Get and verify signatures using rekor-cli tool |
| 8 | Verify with Kyverno | Set up Kyverno policy with Rekor verification |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Steps 1-3: Basic Setup

These steps are identical to the [Quick Start: Signed Provenance](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx) guide. Please follow the instructions in that guide for:

- [Step 1: Generate Signing Keys](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-1-generate-signing-keys)
- [Step 2: Set up Authentication](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-2-set-up-authentication)
- [Step 3: Configure Tekton Chains](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-3-configure-tekton-chains)

    Configure the transparency log of Tekton Chains

    ```shell
    $ kubectl patch tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev config --type=merge -p='{
      "spec": {
        "chain": {
          "transparency.enabled": true
        }
      }
    }'
    ```

:::tip
- If you have private Rekor services, you can set the `transparency.url` to the URL of your Rekor server.
  - `transparency.url: "<https://rekor.sigstore.dev>"`

More details about the configuration, please refer to [Transparency Log](https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/config/#transparency-log)
:::


### Step 4: Re-run the pipeline to generate the image

:::tip
- Since we modified the transparency log configuration, we need to trigger a new pipeline run in [Signed Provenance](../quick_start/signed_provenance.mdx#step-5-run-a-sample-pipeline).
- This will allow Tekton Chains to generate transparency log entries for new image and PipelineRun.
:::

### Step 5: Get the rekor log index

Get the rekor log index from the annotations of the PipelineRun.

```shell
$ export NAMESPACE=<pipeline-namespace>
$ export PIPELINERUN_NAME=<pipelinerun-name>
$ kubectl get pipelinerun -n $NAMESPACE $PIPELINERUN_NAME -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/transparency}'

https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries?logIndex=232330257
```

### Step 6: Get the rekor signature by curl

```shell
$ curl -s "https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries?logIndex=232330257" | jq
```

If you need to view the content of the rekor signature, you can execute the following command:

```shell
$ curl -s "https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries?logIndex=232330257" | jq -r '.[keys[0]].attestation.data | @base64d' | jq .

{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
  "subject": null,
  "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2",
  "predicate": {
    "buildType": "tekton.dev/v1beta1/PipelineRun",
    "builder": {
      "id": "https://alauda.io/builders/tekton/v1"
    },
    "materials": [
      {
        "digest": {
          "sha256": "8d5ea9ecd9b531e798fecd87ca3b64ee1c95e4f2621d09e893c58ed593bfd4c4"
        },
        "uri": "oci://<registry>/devops/tektoncd/hub/buildah"
      }
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "buildFinishedOn": "2025-06-08T03:11:52Z",
      "buildStartedOn": "2025-06-08T03:10:33Z"
    }
  }
}
```

This content is same as the attestation in the image, which verifies the authenticity and integrity of the image content.
The attestation information can be retrieved from Rekor without requiring credentials from the image registry, making it more convenient and accessible for verification purposes.

### Step 7: Get the rekor signature by rekor-cli

Get signature by log index

```shell
# the log index is same as the one in the annotations of the PipelineRun
$ rekor-cli get --log-index 232330257 --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq .
```

Get signature by image digest

```shell
# get the uuid by image digest
$ rekor-cli search --sha da4885861a8304abad71fcdd569c92daf33422073d1102013a1fed615dfb285a

Found matching entries (listed by UUID):
108e9186e8c5677a1364e68001a916d3a7316bc2580bd6b5fbbce39a9c62f13282d3e974a6b434ab

# get the signature by uuid
$ rekor-cli get --uuid 108e9186e8c5677a1364e68001a916d3a7316bc2580bd6b5fbbce39a9c62f13282d3e974a6b434ab --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq .
```

### Step 8: Verify the rekor in Kyverno

Modify the `keys` section of the `ClusterPolicy` to add rekor verification.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
spec:
  rules:
    - name: check-image
      verifyImages:
        - attestors:
            - count: 1
              entries:
                - keys:
                    publicKeys: |- # <- The public key of the signer
                      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                      MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEFZNGfYwn7+b4uSdEYLKjxWi3xtP3
                      UkR8hQvGrG25r0Ikoq0hI3/tr0m7ecvfM75TKh5jGAlLKSZUJpmCGaTToQ==
                      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

                    rekor:
                      ignoreTlog: false
                      # url: <https://rekor.sigstore.dev>
                      # # get the public key from the rekor server
                      # # curl <https://rekor.sigstore.dev>/api/v1/log/publicKey
                      # pubkey: |-
                      #   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                      #   MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE2G2Y+2tabdTV5BcGiBIx0a9fAFwr
                      #   kBbmLSGtks4L3qX6yYY0zufBnhC8Ur/iy55GhWP/9A/bY2LhC30M9+RYtw==
                      #   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

:::details{title="Explanation of YAML fields"}
- `rekor`: The rekor verification configuration.
  - `ignoreTlog`: Whether to ignore the transparency log.
    - If `false`, the rekor server will be verified.
  - `url`: The URL of the rekor server.
    - If not set, the default rekor server `https://rekor.sigstore.dev` will be used.
  - `pubkey`: The public key of the signer.
    - If not set, the public key will be fetched from the rekor server.
    - If the rekor server is private, you need to get the public key from the rekor server.
      - `curl <https://rekor.sigstore.dev>/api/v1/log/publicKey`
:::

If your image not signed, the Pod will be blocked.

```text
Error from server: admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Pod/policy/sign was blocked due to the following policies

only-cosign-image-deploy:
  check-image: 'failed to verify image <registry>/test/chains/demo-1:latest:

```

## Expected Results

After completing this guide:

- You have a working setup with Tekton Chains for keyless signing and Rekor integration
- Your container images are automatically signed and their signatures are stored in Rekor transparency logs
- Image signatures can be verified without managing signing keys
- Only images with valid signatures in Rekor can be deployed in the specified namespace
- You have implemented a keyless supply chain security control by verifying image signatures through Rekor

This guide provides a foundation for implementing keyless signing and verification in your CI/CD pipelines. In a production environment, you should:

1. Configure proper namespace isolation and access controls
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for signature verification failures
3. Regularly review and update security policies
4. Consider deploying private Rekor instances for enhanced security
