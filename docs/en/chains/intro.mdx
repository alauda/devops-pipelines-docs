# Introduction

## Tekton Chains Introduction

Tekton Chains is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller that enables supply chain security features for Tekton pipelines. It works by observing TaskRun and PipelineRun executions, capturing relevant information, and storing it in a cryptographically-signed format. This provides a secure and verifiable record of all pipeline activities, ensuring the integrity of your software supply chain.

Built on the foundation of Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Chains extends the CI/CD capabilities with security features that allow organizations to implement Software Supply Chain Security practices according to industry standards like SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts).

## Tekton Chains Advantages

The core advantages of Tekton Chains are as follows:

- **Secure Software Supply Chain**

  Tekton Chains provides cryptographic verification of all artifacts produced in your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that your software hasn't been tampered with from build to deployment.

- **SLSA Compliance**

  Supports multiple SLSA provenance formats, helping organizations meet industry standards for supply chain security and achieve higher levels of SLSA compliance.

- **Seamless Integration**

  Works natively with Tekton Pipelines, requiring minimal configuration changes to existing CI/CD workflows while adding robust security features.

- **Flexible Storage Options**

  Supports multiple storage backends including Tekton, OCI registries, GCS, and more, allowing you to store signatures and attestations where they make the most sense for your organization.

- **Multiple Signing Methods**

  Supports various signing mechanisms including x509, Cosign, and KMS systems (GCP KMS, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure KMS), providing flexibility in how you secure your supply chain.

## Scenarios

The main application scenarios of Tekton Chains are as follows:

- **Secure CI/CD Pipelines**

  Organizations can use Tekton Chains to add cryptographic verification to their existing CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that all artifacts produced are signed and verifiable.

- **Compliance Requirements**

  For organizations that need to meet regulatory or industry compliance requirements around software supply chain security, Tekton Chains provides the necessary attestations and verifications.

- **Container Image Signing**

  Automatically sign container images built within Tekton pipelines, ensuring that only verified images can be deployed to production environments.

- **Provenance Generation**

  Generate and sign SLSA provenance for all artifacts built in your pipeline, providing a verifiable record of how each artifact was created.

- **Transparency Logging**

  Store signed attestations in transparency logs like Rekor, enabling third-party verification of your software supply chain.

## Limitations

- Tekton Chains requires proper key management for signing artifacts. The security of your supply chain depends on the security of your signing keys.

- Some features may require additional configuration of external services like OCI registries or KMS systems.

- Tekton Chains observes TaskRuns and PipelineRuns after they complete, so there may be a slight delay between when a pipeline finishes and when the attestations are available.
