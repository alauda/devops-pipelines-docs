# Quick Start

This guide helps new users quickly set up Tekton Chains to secure their CI/CD pipelines by generating and verifying cryptographic signatures for Tekton TaskRuns.

## Introduction

### Use Cases

Tekton Chains helps you secure your software supply chain by automatically generating cryptographic signatures for your build artifacts. This quick start demonstrates how to set up Tekton Chains, generate a signing key, run a simple task, and verify its signature.

### Estimated Reading Time

10-15 minutes

## Important Notes

- Tekton Chains is installed by default in the `tekton-pipelines` namespace when using Alauda Devops Pipelines Operator
- The signing keys should be securely managed; in production environments, consider using a key management system (KMS)
- This guide uses the simplest configuration for demonstration purposes

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Tekton Pipelines and Tekton Chains installed via Alauda Devops Pipelines Operator
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured to access your cluster
- `tkn` (Tekton CLI) installed
- `cosign` CLI installed (for key generation and signature verification)

## Process Overview

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate signing keys | Create a key pair for signing artifacts |
| 2 | Configure Tekton Chains | Set up Chains to use the Tekton storage backend |
| 3 | Run a sample task | Create and run a simple TaskRun |
| 4 | Verify the signature | Extract and verify the signature of the TaskRun |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Generate Signing Keys

Tekton Chains uses cryptographic keys to sign artifacts. By default, it looks for a secret named `signing-secrets` in the Chains namespace.

1. Install [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases) if you haven't already
2. Generate a key pair and store it as a Kubernetes secret:

   ```bash
   cosign generate-key-pair k8s://tekton-pipelines/signing-secrets
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter a password, which will be stored in the secret. This command also generates a public key `cosign.pub` in the current folder that will be used later during verification.

3. Verify the secret was created:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret signing-secrets -n tekton-pipelines
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Tekton Chains

By default, Tekton Chains is configured to store signatures in an OCI registry. For this quick start, we'll configure it to store signatures as annotations on the TaskRun itself.

1. Configure Chains to use the Tekton storage backend:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch configmap chains-config -n tekton-pipelines -p='{"data":{"artifacts.taskrun.storage": "tekton"}}'
   ```

2. Set the format to in-toto (SLSA v0.2):

   ```bash
   kubectl patch configmap chains-config -n tekton-pipelines -p='{"data":{"artifacts.taskrun.format": "in-toto"}}'
   ```

3. Restart the Chains controller to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod -n tekton-pipelines -l app=tekton-chains-controller
   ```

### Step 3: Run a Sample Task

Now let's create a simple TaskRun that Chains will automatically sign.

1. Create a simple Task and TaskRun:

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
   kind: Task
   metadata:
     name: hello-world
   spec:
     steps:
       - name: hello
         image: alpine
         script: |
           #!/bin/sh
           
           echo 'Hello, Tekton Chains!'
   ---
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
   kind: TaskRun
   metadata:
     name: hello-world-run
   spec:
     taskRef:
       name: hello-world
   EOF
   ```
  
   :::tip
   If working in a air-gapped environment, please modify the image to a local containing `sh`.
   :::

2. Wait for the TaskRun to complete:

   ```bash
   kubectl get taskrun hello-world-run -w
   ```

   Wait until the status shows `Succeeded`.

### Step 4: Verify the Signature

Once the TaskRun completes, Tekton Chains will automatically sign it. Let's verify the signature.

1. Get the TaskRun UID:

   ```bash
   export TASKRUN_UID=$(kubectl get taskrun hello-world-run -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}')
   ```

2. Extract the signature:

   ```bash
   kubectl get taskrun hello-world-run -o jsonpath="{.metadata.annotations.chains\\.tekton\\.dev/signature-taskrun-$TASKRUN_UID}" | base64 -d > signature
   ```

3. Verify the signature using cosign:

   ```bash
   cosign verify-blob-attestation \
     --key cosign.pub \
     --signature signature \
     --type slsaprovenance \
     --check-claims=false \
     --insecure-ignore-tlog \
     /dev/null
   ```

   If successful, you'll see `Verified OK`.

4. Clean up:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete taskrun hello-world-run
   kubectl delete task hello-world
   ```

## Expected Results

After completing this quick start:

- You have a working Tekton Chains setup with a signing key
- Your TaskRuns are automatically signed when they complete
- You can verify the signatures to ensure the integrity of your builds

This demonstrates the basic functionality of Tekton Chains. In a real-world scenario, you would:

1. Configure Chains to sign container images and store signatures in your registry
2. Set up a verification step in your deployment process
3. Potentially use a cloud KMS for more secure key management

For more advanced configurations, refer to the [Tekton Chains documentation](https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/).
